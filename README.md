The Swedish International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) maintain an Arms Transfers Database which contains information on deals between specific arms suppliers and recipients. I’m building a Plotly Dash app to help visualise this data. The dataset can be downloaded here — https://armstransfers.sipri.org/ArmsTransfer/ImportExport.
